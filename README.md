# Sales_Data_Dashboard

Hello everyone!

Here I'm sharing my first project provided by MeriSKILL "Sales Data Dashboard" done using Power BI tool.


1. Data source: This dataset is an Excel file which is given by MeriSkill for sales analysis. This includes the data of city, day, hour, month, order date, order id, price etc.

2. Data cleaning: There is no null, duplicate data and unwanted columns in this dataset. All the columns are mostly useful for analysis.

3. Visualizations: Provided a card for total product, order Id, sales, average of sales, total quantity, and filter for city and year. Used line and stacked column chart, area chart, line chart, stacked bar chart, azure map.

Conclusion:

Weâ€™ve visualized and analyzed various visualization in the sales dataset. We got some insightful results about the Profit and Sales that can be used to improve future policies. We also found a trend over the year so preparations in stores and warehouses for the next year can be made accordingly. We can now confidently pick up more datasets to define visualization for and visualize them in PowerBi.
